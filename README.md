## Inspiration 
The inspiration behind DPUnity comes from recognizing the need to foster a more inclusive and diverse campus environment at DePauw University. With a significant number of international students and students from various racial backgrounds, it is crucial to address challenges like discrimination, sexual harassment, and bias that some students may face. DPUnity was developed to empower students **by providing a safe, anonymous platform for reporting incidents and offering resources for navigating campus safely and accessing professional mental health support**. Our ultimate goal is to create an inclusive, supportive, and safe atmosphere for all students on campus.

## What is DPUnity
### About
DPUnity is **a web platform designed to enhance inclusion and diversity at DePauw University** by providing students with a safe and anonymous space to report incidents of discrimination, harassment, or bias. Our platform also offers a safe map feature to help students navigate campus securely and connects them to professional mental health mentors for support. Through these features, DPUnity aims to create a more inclusive and supportive campus environment for all students.

### Feature
_DPUnity offers three main features:_

1. **Anonymous Report System:** A secure platform for students to anonymously report incidents related to discrimination, harassment, or bias.
2. **Safe Map:** By analyzing student reports, we provide a map highlighting safe and dangerous locations on campus to help students navigate safely.
3. **Support Services:** Students can access professional mental health mentors to help them cope with and resolve their problems. We directly connect students to our qualified mentors.

### Technologies
- Front-end: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap** for responsive and user-friendly design.
- Back-end: **Mongoose** for database management and integration.
- Map Integration: **Google Maps API** for customizing campus maps and pinning relevant locations.

## How DPUnity created
### The challenges we ran into
As a team of **two freshmen with no prior experience in web development**, we faced numerous challenges while building DPUnity. These challenges were both educational and time-constrained, as we had to learn new technologies and complete the project within 14 days.

_Some of the key challenges we encountered were:_
1. **Learning web development from scratch:** With no prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, we had to self-study and quickly grasp these technologies to build the front-end of our website.
2. **Understanding back-end technologies:** We had to familiarize ourselves with Mongoose for managing databases and integrating them into our project.
Integrating Google Maps API: Customizing the campus map and pinning locations proved challenging as we had to learn the ins and outs of the Google Maps API.
3. **Balancing learning with project progress:** As we were simultaneously learning new skills and applying them to our project, we faced the challenge of managing our time efficiently and prioritizing tasks.
4. **Collaborating effectively:** As a team of two, communication and effective division of tasks were essential. We had to ensure that our individual contributions complemented each other and aligned with the project's overall objectives.
Despite these challenges, we persevered and successfully built DPUnity, a platform that we believe can make a significant positive impact on the DePauw University campus.
